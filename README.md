## Project Status

The project is complete as is for the two-player version, with the AI one-player version to be implemented later.

## Challenges Faced

The biggest challenge that I faced initially was the implementation of factory functions and figuring out the scope of my different functions. I found it difficult to track which functions would be called and accessible at what point, so I took a lot of time watching videos and reading up on scope.

## Future Implementation

- Implement the ai version of the game, perhaps with three levels of difficulty that a user can select. Likely this shall be done using the minimax algorithm, and percentages shall be used to determine the thoroughness of the algorithm
- Highlight the row/column that has won once a player wins
- Add a celebratory animation that pops up for winner / taunting or encouraging message for the loser
